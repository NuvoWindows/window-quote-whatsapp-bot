- [ ] Implement format validation for user inputs

**Tasks:**
1. Expand `messageParser.js` with additional extraction patterns
2. Enhance `quoteService.js` with more pricing variables
3. Add validation for dimensions and window types
4. Implement error handling for edge cases

## Phase 4: User Experience Enhancement
*Estimated timeline: 1-2 weeks*

**Milestone: Improved Conversation Flow**
- [ ] Add contextual follow-up questions when information is missing

- [ ] Include image capability for window style references

**Tasks:**
1. Update WhatsApp message templates for structured responses
2. Enhance conversation context management
3. Add media message support
4. Implement quick replies and suggestion buttons

## Phase 5: Testing & Quality Assurance
*Estimated timeline: 1-2 weeks*

**Milestone: Robust and Reliable Bot**
- [ ] Develop comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Conduct load testing for concurrent users
- [ ] Address edge cases and error scenarios
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting

**Tasks:**
1. Create automated tests for key components
2. Test with various window specifications
3. Simulate error conditions and verify handling
4. Set up monitoring in Railway dashboard
5. Implement error notification system

## Phase 6: Production Deployment
*Estimated timeline: 1 week*

**Milestone: Production-Ready Bot on Render**
- [ ] Set up Render environment
- [ ] Migrate configuration from Railway to Render
- [ ] Implement staging environment
- [ ] Create deployment pipeline

**Tasks:**
1. Configure Render Web Service
2. Set up environment variables in Render
3. Configure domain and SSL certificates
4. Implement progressive rollout strategy
5. Create rollback procedures

## Phase 7: Analytics & Optimization
*Estimated timeline: Ongoing*

**Milestone: Data-Driven Improvements**
- [ ] Implement conversation analytics
- [ ] Track quote conversion rates
- [ ] Analyze common failure points
- [ ] Optimize response times

**Tasks:**
1. Set up analytics tracking
2. Create dashboard for key metrics
3. Implement A/B testing framework
4. Optimize system prompt based on user interactions

## GitHub Project Management

This roadmap will be implemented as a GitHub project with:

1. **Milestones**: Corresponding to each phase
2. **Issues**: Individual tasks within each phase
3. **Labels**: For categorization (bug, enhancement, documentation)
4. **Project Board**: Kanban-style tracking with columns:
   - Backlog
   - Ready
   - In Progress
   - Review
   - Done

## Priority Order

1. Phase 2: AI Integration (highest priority)
2. Phase 3: Quote Processing
3. Phase 4: User Experience Enhancement
4. Phase 5: Testing & Quality Assurance
5. Phase 6: Production Deployment
