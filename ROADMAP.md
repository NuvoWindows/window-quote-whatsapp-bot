**Future Enhancement: Multi-Panel Window Support**
*Estimated timeline: 3-4 weeks*

**Background:** Current system treats each window as a single unit with one operation type. Many windows have multiple panels with different operation types (e.g., fixed center with casement sides).

**Milestone: Comprehensive Multi-Panel Support**
- [ ] Enhance data model to support panel-level specifications
- [ ] Update parser to extract multi-panel configurations
- [ ] Implement panel-level pricing calculations
- [ ] Update validation for panel-specific requirements
- [ ] Enhance AI system prompt for multi-panel conversations

**Required Changes:**

1. **Data Model Changes**
   - Create `window_panels` table to store panel-level details
   - Each window can have multiple panels with own dimensions and operation types
   - Store panel position (left, center, right) and configuration

2. **Message Parser Enhancement**
   - Parse configurations like "fixed center with casement sides"
   - Extract individual panel dimensions: "center 48x60, sides 24x60"
   - Handle common multi-panel patterns and terminology
   - Return panel array in specifications

3. **System Prompt Updates**
   - Educate Claude on multi-panel window terminology
   - Guide question flow for panel configurations
   - Handle complex specs like "bay window with fixed center, double-hung sides"
   - Update information gathering sequence for panel details

4. **Pricing Logic Overhaul**
   - Calculate each panel's price separately
   - Window price is sum of panels
   - Update bay window calculations (already multi-section)
   
5. **Validation System Updates**
   - Panel-specific dimension validation
   - Compatibility checks between adjacent panels
   - Different min/max ranges per panel based on operation type
   - Each operation type should have its own dimension ranges

6. **Quote Generation Changes**
   - Sum panel costs for totals
   - Update PDF templates for panel details
   - Display panel configuration clearly

7. **UI/UX Impact**
   - Admin interface needs panel management
   - Quote display must show panel configurations
   - Conversation flow becomes more complex
   - Need visual representation of panel layouts

**Implementation Phases:**
1. Foundation: Document limitations, gather multi-panel request data
2. Data Model Evolution: Schema updates, migration scripts
3. Parser Enhancement: Multi-panel parsing patterns
4. Pricing Engine: Panel-level calculations
5. AI Integration: Update prompts and conversation flow
6. UI Updates: Admin and customer-facing changes

**Technical Considerations:**
- Maintain backward compatibility with single-panel windows
- Consider performance impact of multiple panel queries
- Implement proper panel relationship constraints
- Handle edge cases (max panels, unusual configurations)
